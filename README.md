## Instructions:

1- First, explore the Next.js file. Take a look around at the structure of the files. Which components are imported and which are exported, etc.

2- Currently, the variable `count` can not be updated in the UI. Re-create the variable using `useState` hook.

3- Create three functions that correspond to the three already existing functions:
Increment: Adds 1 to the count.
Decrement: Removes 1 from the count.
Reset: Brings the count back to 0.

4- Make sure to call the functions in their respective buttons using `onClick`.

\*Bonus:
After finishing all the above,
Create an Input tag that takes a number from the user,
and depending on this number the increament button should increase the counter by its value
